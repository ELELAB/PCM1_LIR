This repository contains the input data for the modelling and simulations, the outputs from analyses and the associated scripts to reproduce our data.

The three main folders in the repository contains:

1. modeller -> the files and scripts to generate the models of the complexes and to perform the structural clustering
2. simulations -> templates files for gromacs to run preparation and md along with bash scripts for the preparation steps
3. conan -> the files and scripts of the contact analyses of the MD simulations, along with the xtc files with teh structures
of the ensemble of PCM1-GABARAP complex
